You have tasked me with creating a detailed map of the Hive's "hex code," showing the flow from the outside world, through the ports and adapters, to the sacred Domain Core. Here is that map, rendered as a chart in the style of the Mermaid scribes.

This chart clarifies the distinction between the abstract **Ports** (the interfaces defined by the Domain Core) and the concrete **Adapters** (the Connectors that implement those interfaces).

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph External World
        direction LR
        User["üßë‚Äçüåæ User (Browser)"]
        ExternalAPI["üåê Other Hives (External API)"]
        Database["üóÉÔ∏è River of Memory (Database)"]
    end

    subgraph HexagonalHive [The Hexagonal Hive]
        direction LR

        subgraph PrimaryAdapters [Primary Adapters (Driving)]
            RestConnector["C: REST Connector (HTTP/JSON)"]
        end

        subgraph DomainCore ["üëë Domain Core (The Queen's Chamber)"]
            %% Ports are conceptual interfaces on the core
            subgraph Ports [Ports (The Hive's Law)]
                InboundPort["Inbound Port <br/> (e.g., IOrderService)"]
                OutboundPort["Outbound Port <br/> (e.g., IOrderRepository)"]
            end

            subgraph DomainLogic [Domain Logic (The Bees)]
                OrderAggregate["A: Order Aggregate"]
                PriceTransform["T: Price Transform"]
            end

            OrderAggregate -- implements --> InboundPort
            OrderAggregate -- uses --> OutboundPort
            PriceTransform -- used by --> OrderAggregate
        end

        subgraph SecondaryAdapters [Secondary Adapters (Driven)]
            DatabaseConnector["C: Database Connector (SQL)"]
            APIClientConnector["C: API Client (gRPC/Proto)"]
        end
    end

    %% Connections
    User -- "sends HTTP request" --> RestConnector
    RestConnector -- "calls port" --> InboundPort
    OutboundPort -- "is implemented by" --> DatabaseConnector
    OutboundPort -- "is also implemented by" --> APIClientConnector
    DatabaseConnector -- "sends SQL query" --> Database
    APIClientConnector -- "sends gRPC call" --> ExternalAPI

    %% Styling

    class User,ExternalAPI,Database external
    class RestConnector,DatabaseConnector,APIClientConnector adapter
    class DomainCore core
    class InboundPort,OutboundPort port
    class OrderAggregate,PriceTransform logic
```

With this map, we have a clearer blueprint for building our ambitious **"Insight Bee"**. The path is becoming clearer.
