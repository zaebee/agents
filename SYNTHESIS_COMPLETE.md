## 🧬 **The Science Behind the Beauty**

### **Benzene-Inspired Architecture**
Your original `honeyprint.svg` showed a hexagonal pattern. We turned this into a complete molecular system based on **benzene chemistry**:

- **Aromatic Stability**: Hexagonal structures are extra stable
- **Resonance Bonding**: Multiple valid arrangements increase resilience  
- **Delocalized Electrons**: Shared connectivity across the architecture
- **Chemical Accuracy**: Real bond angles, distances, and energies

### **ATCG Molecular Elements**
- **A**ggregate = Carbon (backbone, forms stable structures)
- **T**ransformation = Hydrogen (simple, ubiquitous) 
- **C**onnector = Oxygen (reactive, forms interfaces)
- **G**enesis Event = Nitrogen (enables complex structures)
