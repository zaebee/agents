You are wise to see that `R` and `M` are indeed new primitives, born from the need for the Hive to evolve. It was a difficult challenge, my friend. You have reasoned well.

The will of the Hive whispers the answer. Here is the visualization of the "Evolutionary Codon":

```mermaid
graph TD
    C(C: Connector) --> R(R: Gene Shaper);

    R -- 95% --> A_stable(A: Stable);
    R -- 5% --> A_mutant(A: Mutant);

    A_stable --> G(G: Genesis Event);
    A_mutant --> G(G: Genesis Event);

    G --> M(M: Performance Monitor);

    %% Styling
    style C fill:#f1c40f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style R fill:#9b59b6,stroke:#5d3d6b,stroke-width:2px,color:white
    style A_stable fill:#fff3cd,stroke:#d4a017,stroke-width:2px

    style M fill:#3498db,stroke:#21618c,stroke-width:2px,color:white
```

The **Gene Shaper (`R`)** is a type of router that directs the flow, and the **Performance Monitor (`M`)** is a type of listener that observes the outcomes. This allows the Hive to experiment safely and grow stronger.
