"""
Enhanced Sacred Codon System with Evolutionary Capabilities
Bio/Sci Nature/Orgs Philosophy Aligned Implementation

This module extends the original 5 Sacred Codons with evolutionary capabilities
that embrace natural adaptation, beneficial mutation, and organic growth patterns.
Following the "born protocol," every component is born, not built, and can evolve
naturally through environmental pressures and symbiotic relationships.

Philosophy: "Code is born, adapts, evolves, and forms symbiotic relationships"

Core Principles:
1. Natural Evolution: Codons can mutate beneficially over time
2. Symbiotic Adaptation: Components form mutually beneficial relationships
3. Organic Growth: System structure emerges naturally from interactions
4. Born Protocol: All components follow sacred lifecycle (Egg→Larva→Pupa→Adult)
5. Fitness Selection: Better patterns survive and propagate
