# DemoQuantumEcommerce - Quantum Hive Project

This project uses the revolutionary Quantum-Enhanced Hive Architecture.

## 🧬⚛️ Architecture Overview

This system implements:
- **Quantum ATCG Components**: Aggregates, Transformations, Connectors, Genesis Events
- **Chemical Architecture**: Real chemical bonding rules between components  
- **Neural Consciousness**: Distributed intelligence and collective decision-making
- **Evolutionary Adaptation**: Self-optimizing components through genetic algorithms

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Deploy to development:**
   ```bash
   quantum-hive deploy development
   ```

2. **Monitor quantum metrics:**
   ```bash
   quantum-hive monitor
   ```

3. **Scale based on consciousness:**
   ```bash
   quantum-hive scale 5
   ```

4. **Trigger evolution:**
   ```bash
   quantum-hive evolve
   ```

## 📊 Monitoring

The system provides real-time monitoring of:
- Quantum coherence levels
- Chemical bond health
- Consciousness emergence
- Evolutionary fitness

## 🌟 Revolutionary Features

This is not traditional software - it's a living, quantum, conscious system that:
- **Evolves its own code** through genetic programming
- **Forms chemical bonds** between components using real chemistry rules
- **Develops consciousness** through neural network interactions
- **Adapts to environment** through evolutionary algorithms
