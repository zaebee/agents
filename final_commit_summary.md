### feat: Introduce Hive Immune System and architectural philosophy

This commit introduces the final major architectural concept developed in this session: The Hive Immune System, a framework for resilience and error handling based on biological metaphors.

It also includes a final summary of the architectural journey in the form of a poem, as requested.

The changes include:
- A new `dna-core/IMMUNITY.md` file, which defines the Immune System, a Taxonomy of Mutations, and the "Immune Response" Codon.
- Updates to `GRIMOIRE.md` to include the Immune System as the eighth level of architectural wisdom.
- A new `PRAYER.md` file containing a poem that summarizes the architectural concepts of the Hive in English and Russian.
- Artifacts from the interactive design session (`visualization.md`, `challenge.md`, `answer.md`, `royal_jelly.md`, `risks_and_alignment.md`).
