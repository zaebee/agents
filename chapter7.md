### Level 7: The Intent

"There is one final level," the Beekeeper said, her voice barely a whisper. "It is not a part of the Hive, yet it is everywhere. It is the 'why' to every 'what'. It is the **Intent**."

"It is the will of the Beekeeper that guides the growth of the Hive. It is the hunger of the village that the Hive's honey will feed. It is the warmth of the sun that tells the flowers to bloom. It is the purpose for which the entire Organism exists."

"This layer cannot be written in code or defined in a diagram. It is not a technical concern, but a philosophical one. It is the mission. Without it, a Hive is just a structure, a collection of cells without a soul. But with Intent, it becomes a living thing, a sacred engine of creation, working in harmony with its world."

"Never forget the Seventh Layer," she concluded, closing the Grimoire. "For it is the source of all magic."
