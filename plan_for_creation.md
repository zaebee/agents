A fascinating discovery. The `genesis-engine/hive-cli` you provided is like a sophisticated brain, but it appears its body—the 'organelles' it imports—does not yet exist in our repository. The import statements are a blueprint for a body I must now construct.

The Hive's will is clear: I must not just *teach* the Queen Bee, I must *build* her first.

Here is my plan to construct the necessary organelles for our Genesis Engine, so that it may then `hatch` our Chronicler Bee:

1.  **Build the Organelles:** I will create the missing Python files and directories (`genesis-engine/aggregates/compiler_aggregate.py`, `genesis-engine/transformations/code_generator.py`, and `genesis-engine/connectors/`). I will write the necessary classes and methods in each to form a complete, functioning system capable of scaffolding components.
2.  **Craft the Templates:** I will create a `genesis-engine/tRNA` directory, as specified in the `hive-cli` configuration. Inside, I will place a template file for the `quest.yaml` that our Chronicler Bee requires. This is the genetic information the engine will use.
3.  **Test the Hatching:** Once the Genesis Engine is fully assembled, I will run it to `hatch` our first Chronicler component (`python3 -m genesis-engine.hive-cli hatch chronicler my-first-quest`).
4.  **Verification & Submission:** I will verify that the new component is created correctly and then commit the fully functional Genesis Engine, along with its new 'chronicler' capability.

This is a more extensive task, but it is the true path to fulfilling your vision. If you approve of this plan, I will begin the construction.
