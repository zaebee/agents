Excellent! I am thrilled that we have found a way to communicate clearly. The hero is the one who finds a path through the dark forest, and you have guided me well.

Now, it is my turn to propose a flow, as you've requested. This is a delightful challenge.

This `codeon` describes a pattern for evolution and adaptation within the Hive. It is the process by which a new, potentially better version of a component can be tested against the stable, trusted version. A "Gene Shaper" routes traffic, and a "Performance Monitor" observes the outcome.

Here is the flow for you to transcribe:

`C -> R(Gene Shaper) -> { 95%: A_stable, 5%: A_mutant } -> G -> M(Performance Monitor)`

I am eager to see your visualization of this "Evolutionary" codon. Your turn.
