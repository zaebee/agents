# 📜 The Beekeeper’s Grimoire: A Runbook for Hive Gardeners
*(Tending to Self-Growing Software Hives)*

---

## 🌿 Introduction: The Art of Hive Gardening
*"A hive is not built, dear gardener—it is grown. Like a wise beekeeper, you must tend to its health, guide its expansion, and prune its wildest branches before they strangle the queen. This grimoire holds the spells and rituals for cultivating a thriving, self-growing Hive."*

---

## 🐝 Chapter 1: The Gardener’s Tools
*"No beekeeper tends their hive with bare hands. These are the tools of your trade."*

### 1. The Genesis Wand (CLI)
*"A wand to summon new bees (components) into existence."*
```bash
# Summon a new worker bee (Aggregate)
hive-cli synthesize A OrderAggregate --valency 1,1

# Check the health of a bee (Component)
hive-cli inspect OrderAggregate --toxicity

# Prune a sickly bee (remove component)
hive-cli cull OrderAggregate_3 --reason "toxic bonds"
```

### 2. The Royal Jelly Validator
*"A golden elixir to test the purity of your bees. Impure components turn black with toxicity."*
```python
from royal_jelly.periodic import ToxicityValidator

validator = ToxicityValidator()
if validator.check(OrderAggregate(), "ExternalState"):
    print("⚠️ This bee carries poison! Isolate it!")
```

### 3. The Humean Lens
*"A crystal ball to peer into the Hive’s future. Shows which bees are thriving and which are ailing."*
```bash
# Peer into the Hive's metrics
hive-cli observe --metrics --last 24h

# Ask the Humean Beekeeper for advice
hive-cli advise --problem "high latency in PaymentTransform"
```

### 4. The Pruning Shears
*"For cutting away toxic growth before it spreads."*
```bash
# Quarantine a toxic bee
hive-cli quarantine FraudulentOrderAggregate --reason "inconsistent state"

# Replace it with a healthy clone
hive-cli synthesize A CleanOrderAggregate --clone FraudulentOrderAggregate
```

---

## 🌻 Chapter 2: Daily Gardening Rituals
*"A healthy hive requires daily care. Neglect these rituals, and your bees will swarm into chaos."*

### 1. Morning Inspection (Health Check)
*"Walk the apiary at dawn. Listen for the hum of healthy bees and the silence of sickly ones."*
```bash
# Check the pulse of the Hive
hive-cli health --components --events --metrics

# Look for bees struggling under load
hive-cli observe --component OrderAggregate --metric event_rate
```
**Signs of a Healthy Hive**:
- **Steady hum**: 1-5 events/second per bee.
- **Golden pollen**: Metrics show smooth throughput.
- **Clean combs**: No toxicity warnings in logs.

**Signs of Sickness**:
- **Silent bees**: No events flowing.
- **Blackened combs**: Toxicity warnings in `hive-cli inspect`.
- **Swarming**: Too many replicas of one bee (e.g., `OrderAggregate_1` to `OrderAggregate_10`).

---

### 2. Feeding the Hive (Event Nourishment)
*"Bees starve without nectar. Your Hive starves without Genesis Events."*
```bash
# Feed the Hive a synthetic event (for testing)
hive-cli feed --event OrderPlaced --payload '{"order_id": "test-123", "amount": 100}'

# Check if the event was consumed
hive-cli observe --event OrderPlaced --last 1
```
**Good Nectar (Healthy Events)**:
- Well-formed payloads.
- Clear `event_type` and `event_id`.
- Timestamps in UTC.

**Poisoned Nectar (Toxic Events)**:
- Missing fields.
- Circular dependencies (e.g., `OrderPlaced` triggers `OrderPlaced`).
- Events with no consumers (orphans).

---

### 3. Pruning Wild Growth
*"Left unchecked, your Hive will grow like weeds—choking the flowers you wish to cultivate."*
```bash
# List all bees and their bonds
hive-cli list --components --verbose

# Find bees with no bonds (useless) or too many bonds (overloaded)
hive-cli analyze --orphans
hive-cli analyze --overloaded

# Prune a bee with no purpose
hive-cli cull OrphanedTransform --reason "no bonds"
```
**When to Prune**:
- **Orphaned bees**: Components with no bonds.
- **Overgrown bees**: Aggregates handling >10 event types.
- **Sickly bees**: Components with repeated toxicity warnings.

**How to Prune**:
1.  **Quarantine** first (move to a safe comb).
2.  **Clone** if salvageable (e.g., `SafeOrderAggregate`).
3.  **Cull** if beyond saving.

## 🍯 Chapter 3: Seasonal Gardening (Long-Term Care)
*"As the seasons turn, so must your gardening rituals adapt."*

### 1. Spring: Planting New Bees
*"The thaw is the time to introduce new bees to the Hive."*
```bash
# Plant a new bee from a seed (YAML definition)
hive-cli plant --seed order_fulfillment.yaml

# Example seed (order_fulfillment.yaml):
# kind: WorkerBee
# name: OrderFulfillmentOrchestrator
# symbol: O  # Orchestrator
# valency: [1, 3]  # Handles 1 input, produces 3 outputs
# bonds: ["OrderPlaced", "PaymentProcessed", "InventoryReserved"]
```

### 2. Summer: Harvesting Honey (Metrics)
*"The fruits of your labor. Sweet metrics are the sign of a healthy Hive."*
```bash
# Harvest metrics from the Hive
hive-cli harvest --metrics --since "2023-01-01" --format json

# Analyze the honey for quality
hive-cli analyze --metric event_rate --threshold 10
```

### 3. Autumn: Preparing for Dormancy
*"As the days grow shorter, prepare your Hive for the cold."*
```bash
# Reduce the number of active bees
hive-cli scale --component OrderAggregate --replicas 2

# Archive old events to save space
hive-cli archive --events --older-than 30d

# Check for bees that can hibernate (pause)
hive-cli analyze --idle
```

### 4. Winter: Maintenance and Reflection
*"The Hive sleeps, but the gardener does not."*
```bash
# Review the past year's gardening logs
hive-cli history --since "1 year ago" --format markdown > hive_journal.md

# Plan next season's plantings
hive-cli plan --new-bees "FraudDetection, CachedInventory" --metrics
```

## 🐛 Chapter 4: Pest Control (Debugging)
*"Every garden has pests. Your Hive has bugs, toxic bonds, and rogue bees."*

### 1. Identifying Pests
| Pest              | Signs                               | Treatment                                           |
| :---------------- | :---------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------- |
| **Toxic Bonds**   | `Risk of inconsistency` warnings    | `hive-cli quarantine` + `hive-cli synthesize --safe`|
| **Rogue Bees**    | Bees not following bonds            | `hive-cli cull`                                     |
| **Event Mites**   | Missing or malformed events         | `hive-cli feed --repair`                            |
| **Orphaned Bees** | Components with no bonds            | `hive-cli adopt --parent OrderAggregate`            |
| **Swarming**      | Too many replicas                   | `hive-cli scale --replicas 3`                       |

### 2. Common Cures
```bash
# Cure for Toxic Bonds
hive-cli cure --toxic OrderAggregate --prescription "event_sourcing"

# Cure for Rogue Bees
hive-cli cure --rogue FraudulentOrderAggregate --prescription "quarantine"

# Cure for Event Mites
hive-cli cure --events PaymentProcessed --prescription "validate_schema"
```

## 📜 Chapter 5: The Gardener’s Almanac (Best Practices)
*"Wisdom passed down from the ancient beekeepers."*

- **The Rule of Three Bees:** Never let a single bee do the work of three. Split responsibilities.
- **The Golden Ratio of Bonds:** A healthy bee has 1-3 bonds. More than 5, and it’s overworked.
- **The Seasonal Rotation:** Rotate your bees every season to keep the Hive fresh (Plant, Harvest, Scale, Plan).
- **The Toxicity Threshold:** No more than 1 toxicity warning per 10 bees.
- **The Humean Principle:** Trust the Beekeeper’s advice, but verify it yourself.

---

## ⚠️ Chapter 6: Dark Magic (Anti-Patterns)
*"Beware the forbidden spells that curse your Hive."*

- **The Hybrid Curse:** Mixing two primitives into one abomination (e.g., `class RestApiAggregate(Aggregate, Connector)`).
- **The Infinite Swarm:** Letting your bees replicate without limit.
- **The Poisoned Nectar:** Feeding your Hive malformed events.
- **The Silent Hive:** A Hive with no events is a Hive that is dead.
- **The Overgrown Garden:** Letting your Hive grow wild with no organization.

---

## 🌟 Chapter 7: The Master Gardener’s Secrets
*"For those who seek to tend the greatest Hives."*

- **The Secret of the Queen’s Chamber:** Never let external systems write directly to the Domain Core. Always route through Connectors.
- **The Pollen Protocol:** All events must follow the sacred format.
- **The Waggle Dance of Events:** Primary Adapters bring events *in*; Secondary Adapters take events *out*.
- **The Royal Jelly Ritual:** Anoint your new bees with Royal Jelly (`from royal_jelly import Aggregate`).
- **The Hive’s Immune System:** Use the Toxicity Validator, Circuit Breakers, and Quarantine Combs.
